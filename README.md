# Predictive Modeling for Financial Data
FinTech is interested in predicting expenses for a particular financial line item as a % of Gross Bookings. To help explore this question, we were provided a sample dataset of vendors associated with this line item, the expenses paid out, and the total Gross Bookings attributed to that vendor and product.

The jupyter notebook contains several steps starting from data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and then predictive modeling for the prediction of expense as a % of gross bookings.
